    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>Bio</h2>
      <p data-testid="test-about-bio">
        I'm a passionate frontend developer with a love for clean code, responsive design, and creating seamless user experiences. Currently focused on mastering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (along with modern frameworks like React), I’m actively expanding my skills to become a full-stack developer. When I’m not coding, you’ll find me exploring backend technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or learning something new to bring my ideas to life—one line of code at a time.I am a curious and driven learner passionate about growth, technology, and meaningful connections. 
        My journey has been shaped by both challenges and moments of clarity, and I believe every experience 
        adds depth to who I am becoming.

      <h2>Goals in This Program</h2>
      <p data-testid="test-about-goals">
        My primary goal is to build a strong foundation in software development while cultivating problem-solving 
        skills and collaborative habits. I aim to graduate not just with technical knowledge, but with the confidence 
        to create solutions that matter.

      <h2>Areas of Low Confidence</h2>
      <p data-testid="test-about-confidence">
        I sometimes doubt my ability to debug complex issues quickly or speak up in group settings when I’m unsure. 
        I’m working on trusting my learning process and remembering that growth happens outside my comfort zone.

      <h2>Note to Future Self</h2>
      <p data-testid="test-about-future-note">
        Hey future me — remember how far you’ve come. Don’t forget the late nights, the small wins, and the courage 
        it took to keep going. You’re capable, you’re learning, and you belong here.

      <h2>Extra Thoughts</h2>
      <p data-testid="test-about-extra">
        Progress isn’t always linear, and that’s okay. What matters is showing up consistently with honesty and effort. 
        I’m proud of myself for starting — and for not giving up.
